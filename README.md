The web visualation is created using the D3.js JavaScript library. The `/D3-challenge/assets/js/app.js` JavaScript file provides the interactive behavior of the visualization. A data file, `/D3-challenge/data/data.csv`, is read using D3. An svg graphic is put into the `div` with `id="scatter"`.  As the user clicks different axis labels, the graph is updated using on click functions for the horizontal and vertical axes.
